Random Quotes generator Machine / API 

This is a Random Quoutes Generator API, Developed in Node.js. I am maintaining a json file named `quotes.db` which is working like a database to get the Random Quote.

**If you want to contribute to the Node.js part then**

- After that just Open the folder and write this.

**If you want to Add Quotes**

Than just Add the New quote in json format at the end of `quotes.db`

Thank you.
